							At the grocery store, pick up your raw chicken last, just before you head to the check-out line. And have the checker wrap the chicken in a plastic bag in case the package leaks.
							A whole cooked chicken can be kept in the refrigerator for 3 days; cut-up cooked chicken can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days.
							Never leave raw or frozen chicken at room temperature, which encourages the growth of bacteria like Salmonella and Listeria. Cooked chicken should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours.
							Freeze any chicken that won’t be used right away. You can freeze it in its store packaging, but if you plan on storing it for longer than two months, unwrap the chicken and rewrap it in heavy duty aluminum foil and a plastic freezer bag. Chicken can be frozen as long as one year without sacrificing quality.
							Thaw frozen chicken slowly and safely. It will take anywhere from 24 hours to two days to thaw a whole chicken in the refrigerator, and about 2 to 9 hours for cut-up chicken parts (less for boneless pieces). You can thaw chicken more quickly in a cold water bath or by using the defrost cycle of the microwave. But never thaw frozen chicken by leaving it out at room temperature.
							Marinating or brining? Always let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator, even for a short soak of 30 minutes. And never baste the cooked chicken with the same marinade that’s touched raw chicken: either make extra marinade and set aside a portion just for basting, or boil it for two to three minutes, enough time to kill any bacteria. See our collection of marinade recipes.
							There are many ways to cook your chicken. You can bake or roast chicken, fry or sauté it, or BBQ or grill it. Check out all of our Chicken Recipes.

							Baking and Roasting Chicken
							What’s the difference between baking and roasting chicken? You roast a whole chicken, and you bake chicken Parmesan, right? Well, yes; but these days, the difference is mostly a question of semantics. Initially, “to roast” meant to cook over an open flame. You roasted a whole chicken on a spit. Today, though, you typically roast that whole chicken in the oven, where you do your baking, too. Both methods use dry heat to cook the insides and crisp up the outsides.

							But if you want to get technical, there’s this. When you roast a chicken or a butternut squash or rack of lamb, you’re roasting something that is essentially whole. It has that complete structure, that one-ness about it. On the other hand, when you bake bread or a chicken casserole, you’re cooking a collection of distinct ingredients into a uniform whole; through baking, they become one. Here are some top-rated Chicken Casserole Recipes to help you ponder the distinction.

							There are other quasi-defining features of roasting versus baking. Did you cover the pan? You might be baking. Roasts, as they did back in the days when meat hovered over open flames, are often cooked without covering. Did you baste? You’re probably roasting.

							The less tender cuts of beef can be tenderized by marinating the meat before cooking either with a homemade or bottled marinade , or a store-bought quick marinade mix. Cooking the cut of beef according to the proper cooking method for that cut also will give you maximum tenderness. Stewing beef and pot roasts should be cooked in liquid for a long period of time.
							Check your meat label for the cooking method. If the label reads "marinating steak," then this steak should be marinated to enable you to get the eating satisfaction you desire. The most common marinating steaks are: inside, outside and eye of round, sirloin tip and flank steaks. For cooking instructions see Marinating Steaks. Other cuts of beef can be marinated for 15 to 30 minutes to enhance their flavour.? 
							Is it safe to eat medium-rare roast beef or steak? I have heard so many conflicting reports about what is safe to eat. Beef roasts and steaks can be enjoyed medium-rare because if bacteria are present they are found on the surface of the meat. The high temperatures reached on the surface of roasts or steaks during cooking will kill any bacteria. For medium-rare doneness, remove from the heat at 140°F/60°C; the temperature will rise an additional 5°F (3°C) during standing.?? However, in the grinding process, any bacteria on the surface of meat are spread throughout. Therefore, ground beef (e.g. hamburgers and meatloaf) must be cooked thoroughly to 160°F (71°C).

							We recommend people do NOT rinse meat (or poultry) before cooking. In fact, the meat would become waterlogged, making it soggy and less flavourful. Meat (and poultry) is ready to use right out of the package.?? If there were any bacteria on the outer surface of the raw meat or poultry, the rinsing procedure could potentially cross-contaminate your sink. This would be especially problematic if you then washed fruits and vegetables in the sink (without sanitizing it first) and ate them raw.?? The high temperature reached during cooking destroys any bacteria that are potentially on foods. The best way to tell if meats and poultry have reached proper doneness temperatures is to use a digital rapid-read thermometer to check the internal temperature in the centre of the food.

							The practice of salting before cooking has long been debated, with concerns this would toughen and dry meat. We found that meat allowed to stand after salting did have increased loss in juices, however, we also noted benefits. Steaks salted shortly before cooking has lower cooking losses and scored higher for flavour, browning, juiciness and overall tenderness. An added bonus: you'll likely find you need less salt for seasoning if done prior to cooking since more complex flavours develop, not just a salt flavour.

							So you want to know how to make sushi?
							Good. You're in the right place.

							In order to make a fine japanese sushi roll (or nigiri) you don't need to go through five years of fish cutting studies in Japan, neither you need anyone telling you that your first time ever sushi looks more like a sea cucumber in rush hour out of the water.
							What you do need is some goodwill and a good guide to help you through those rough times.
							Get your hands wet, and make about a handful of rice to a ball of rice. It's important to keep your hands wet while working with sushi rice because it is sticky. When you work with the nori though, you should keep them as dry as you can. That is why you should have a bowl of water (with a bit of rice vinegar added to it) and a dry hand-towel nearby when making sushi.

							Gently put the rice ball in the middle of the nori sheet, and start spreading it equally on the nori, creating a layer of rice covering almost the entire sheet except the upper margin of about 2 cm that should be kept uncovered. Later on, the margins need to be empty of rice in order to close to sushi roll properly. Be careful not to compress the rice, but merely spread it over the nori.

							Let's lay down the roll filling, for example a slice of sushi grade tuna, on the edge of the nori. You can add a slice or two of vegetables, you might want to use a long slice of avocado or maybe cucumber for this especially on stops to allow it to roll tightly.

							Using the closer edge of the rolling mat, close on the filling with the nori making a rectangular shaped hill and tighten it from above.

							Move forward, continue rolling in the rectangular hill steps, keeping it tight with every move until you reach the end of the nori. Put pressure on the roll from all three sides at all time, especially on stops to allow it to roll tightly. Make sure you tighten the roll moving from the ends to the center. Be careful not to squeeze out the roll filling.

							Use a wet, sharp knife to cut the roll in to little sushi units. 6-8 units per roll - that's your call. It is useful to keep the knife wet when in between, that helps cutting through the rice and nori.

							Well, the best thing is to get sushi equipment and ingredients to start with. You can probably everything you need your local asian food store. If you'd like to browse for ingredient and accesories online, check out our sushi e-Store, for sushi kits and more. You might also want to know how to prepare sushi rice, or to read more about sushi grade fish for your sushi roll.


							How to make smoked salmon sushi
							Wrap your bamboo mat with plastic wrap. This is necessary in order to prevent rice from sticking to the mat and to allow easy clean up between rolls. 

							Take a nori sheet, and break it in half. If it doesn't break easily, you can toast it for a few seconds or use scissors to cut it. Place one half on the mat, with the shiny side facing down. In this example I actually used the entire nori sheet to get a larger roll, although it's more common to use half.
							Grab a handful of prepared sushi rice, and spread it gently over the nori - about 1 cm high. There's no need to press the rice down onto the nori, only spread it to cover the sheet. Cover the entire sheet if you are using half a nori, and the about 80% of it if you are using a full nori. Flip the nori so that the rice is now facing down. 

							Take about 75gr of smoked salmon per roll, and line it nicely along the nori sheet on the end closer to you. Make sure you use whole chuncks of salmon, not need to break it apart too much. At the same time try to make the salmon line as even as you can.

							On top of the salmon, line up 1-2 thick slices of avocado. If you are not planning to eat the sushi right away, this might be a good time to squeeze a few drops of lemon juice on the avocado to prevent it from turning brown. 

							Roll it inside out. You can find detailed instructions on how to roll inside out sushi here.

							Cut into 8 equal pieces. For best results first cut in half, then cut each half into two, and then again. Plate it in any formation you choose. You can be very creative in the way you final touch the dish, for example a tiny drop of thick Teriyaki sauce on top of each sushi piece would do very nicely.

							Best served with soy sauces, pickled ginger (gari) and wasabi.
